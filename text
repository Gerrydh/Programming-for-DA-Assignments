A permutation is an arrangement of all or part of a set of objects, *with* regard to the order of the arrangement. An example would be 
if we had a set of 3 numbers:1,2,3. A question might be, how many ways cane we arrange 2 numbers from that set, each possible arrangement 
would be an example of a permutation. [https://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=permutations]
