Chi-square

The chi-squared distribution is used mainly in hypothesis testing, the reason it is used in this type of testing is the the relationship 
to the normal distribution. The variable is achieved by summing the squares of dataframe independent, standard normally distributed random 
variables [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.chisquare.html#numpy.random.chisquare] standard norma The 
simpliest chi-squared distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution, so whenever a normal distribution could be used for a 
hypothesis test, a chi-squared distribution could be used. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution]

The mean of a Chi Square distribution is its degree of freedom (The number of independent ways by which a dynamic system can move, wothout 
violating any constraint implosed on it [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)]). Chi Square distributions are 
positively skewed, with the degree of skew decreasing with increasing degrees of freedom.

Probability Distribution(*START OF ASSIGNMENT)
A probability distribution is a table or equation that links each outcome of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurance.

Uniform Distribution
This is the the simplest distribution as it occurs when all of the values of a random variable occur with equal probability. If a dice
is thrown, there are 6 possibile ouctcomes. Each possible outcome is a random variable - x- and each outcome is equally likely to occur

F distribution
The F distribution tests whether two independent samples have been drawn for the normal populations with the same variance, or if 
two independent estimates of the population variance are similar or not, as it is often desirable to compare two variances rather than
two averages.[https://explorable.com/f-distribution]
