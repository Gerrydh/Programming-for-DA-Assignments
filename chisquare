Chi-square

The chi-squared distribution is used mainly in hypothesis testing, the reason it is used in this type of testing is the the relationship 
to the normal distribution. The variable is achieved by summing the squares of dataframe independent, standard normally distributed random 
variables [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.random.chisquare.html#numpy.random.chisquare] standard norma The 
simpliest chi-squared distribution is the square of a standard normal distribution, so whenever a normal distribution could be used for a 
hypothesis test, a chi-squared distribution could be used. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution]

The mean of a Chi Square distribution is its degree of freedom (The number of independent ways by which a dynamic system can move, wothout 
violating any constraint implosed on it [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)]). Chi Square distributions are 
positively skewed, with the degree of skew decreasing with increasing degrees of freedom.

np.random.chisquare(100,1000)

x = np.random.chisquare(100,1000)
plt.hist(x)
plt.show(x)



Probability Distribution(*START OF ASSIGNMENT)
A probability distribution is a table or equation that links each outcome of a statistical experiment with its probability of occurance.

Uniform Distribution
This is the the simplest distribution as it occurs when all of the values of a random variable occur with equal probability. If a dice
is thrown, there are 6 possibile ouctcomes. Each possible outcome is a random variable - x- and each outcome is equally likely to occur
[https://stattrek.com/probability-distributions/probability-distribution.aspx]



F distribution
The F distribution tests whether two independent samples have been drawn for the normal populations with the same variance, or if 
two independent estimates of the population variance are similar or not, as it is often desirable to compare two variances rather than
two averages.[https://explorable.com/f-distribution]


Exponential Distribution

The Exponential distrobution is one of the most widely used continuous distributions. It can be described as the time taken between two 
events occuring continuously and independently at a constant average rate [10]. This distribution has *memoryless* property meaning that
it 'forgets' what has come before it, in other words, if you continue to wait, the length you wait, neither increases or descreases the
probability of an event occuring [11].
This distribution can be used for testing product reliability and for modelling waiting times.
The below is the exponential function- f(x) = λe(−λx) where x ≥ 0. The parameter λ determines the “rate” at which events occur.

THe graph illustrates how the shape of the distribution changes as the rate of change, λ, increase [12].

A simple example

A simple Exponential graph would look like something.



****Poisson Distribution

Is a descrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occuring in a fixed interval of time
or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event [13]. 

The poisson Distribution applies when:

1. The event os something that can be counted in integers
1. Occurrences are independent, so that one occurrence neither deminishes nor increases the chance of another
1. the average frequency of occurance for the time period is known,and:
1. It is possible to count how many events have occured

It most commenly used for rare events [14]

>>> import numpy as np
>>> s = np.random.poisson(5, 10000)
Display histogram of the sample:

>>>
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> count, bins, ignored = plt.hist(s, 14, density=True)
>>> plt.show()


Hypergeometric Distribution

Used to calculate the statistical significance of having drawn specific *k* successes (out of *n* draws) from the population. It is 
often used to identify which sub-populations are over- or under-represented in the sample [15]. An example of the Hypergeometric
distribution

It is used in which selections are made from two groups without replacing members of the group. It is often  employed in random sampling
for statistical quality control.

>>> ngood, nbad, nsamp = 100, 2, 10
# number of good, number of bad, and number of samples
>>> s = np.random.hypergeometric(ngood, nbad, nsamp, 1000)
>>> hist(s)
#   note that it is very unlikely to grab both bad items

>>> s = np.random.hypergeometric(15, 15, 15, 100000)
>>> sum(s>=12)/100000. + sum(s<=3)/100000.
#   answer = 0.003 ... pretty unlikely!
